three tables: smob, load, item
smob columns: id, name
load tables: smob, item, count, when
item table: id, name, type, etc etc
when someone kills a smob:
create a record in the item table for the item if it doesn't exist
create a record in the smob table if it doesn't exist
then create a LOAD record for each item found on the smob
probably want to have another id for the load table which is shared across the entire load
so if you get 10 items from one kill, you have one smob entry, 10 item entries, 10 load entries (fk to the same smob, to individual items, sharing a load_id)
then you can do averages to see, out of X loads in the load table (load id), how many times was X item present
load table might also include where on the smob it was found, so load location could be one of: chest, sack, inventory, equipment
scratch something out and i'll integrate it
actually, i'm sorry add one more table
smob, load, load_item, and item
load has fields: smob, who, when
load_item has fields: load, item, count, location
so the number of times a smob has been recorded is a simple count of LOAD records grouped by smob id
the average number of items per load per smob is a count of LOAD_ITEM records grouped by load and smob id





smob columns: id, name
load tables: smob, item, count, when
item table: id, name, type, etc etc
smob, load, load_item, and item
load has fields: smob, who, when
load_item has fields: load, item, count, location
